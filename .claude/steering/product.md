## Security Considerations

- **Data Sovereignty**: All sensitive data must remain in controlled environment
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every request requires authentication and authorization
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all sensitive operations
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit protection
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and least privilege principle
