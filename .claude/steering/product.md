# Product Steering Document

## Product Vision

**Mission**: 为渗透测试人员提供漏洞管理平台，将手工报告编写时间从2小时降到10分钟，实现漏洞全生命周期管理。

**Problem Statement**: Penetration testers spend excessive time on manual report generation and lack efficient tools for vulnerability lifecycle management, knowledge sharing, and collaborative security testing workflows.

**Platform Positioning**:
This is a vulnerability information management platform focused on:

- Recording and organizing penetration testing discoveries
- Secure storage of POCs and sensitive information
- Collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Automated report generation

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- **Penetration Testing Professionals**: Individual security consultants and testers
- **Security Consulting Firms**: Teams conducting client penetration testing
- **Enterprise Security Teams**: Internal security teams performing regular assessments

### User Personas

- **Solo Penetration Tester**: Needs efficient report generation and knowledge base building
- **Security Team Lead**: Requires project coordination and team collaboration features
- **Security Manager**: Needs visibility into testing progress and standardized reporting

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Dramatic Time Reduction**: From 2 hours to 10 minutes for report generation
2. **Vulnerability Lifecycle Management**: Complete tracking from discovery to remediation
3. **Knowledge Base Building**: Reusable vulnerability templates and POCs
4. **Professional Reporting**: Automated generation of professional penetration testing reports
5. **Secure Collaboration**: Safe sharing of sensitive security findings

## Key Features

### Target Management

- Testing target asset information management (websites, servers, APIs, etc.)
- Target system discovery and inventory
- Technology stack identification and documentation
- Target scope definition and boundary management

### Vulnerability Recording

- Complete vulnerability information capture
- POC (Proof of Concept) storage and management
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- CVSS scoring and risk assessment
- Screenshot and evidence attachment

### Vulnerability Classification

- OWASP-based vulnerability categorization system
- Severity assessment and CVSS scoring
- Vulnerability status tracking (open, fixed, accepted, false_positive)
- Risk assessment and impact analysis

### Long-term Goals

- **Vulnerability Templates**: Common vulnerability quick-entry templates
- **Knowledge Base**: Building reusable enterprise vulnerability knowledge base

### Report Generation

- Automated professional report creation
- Customizable report templates
- Executive summary generation
- Technical details compilation
- Export in multiple formats (PDF, Word, etc.)

## Platform Boundaries

### What We Are

- **Vulnerability Information Management Platform**: Centralized vulnerability data organization
- **Security Testing Workflow Tool**: Streamlined penetration testing processes
- **Knowledge Sharing Platform**: Collaborative security expertise building
- **Professional Reporting System**: Automated documentation generation

### What We Are NOT

- **Vulnerability Scanner**: No automated vulnerability discovery
- **Attack Platform**: No exploitation execution environment
- **Project Management Tool**: Focus on targets and vulnerabilities, not project workflows

**Clear Boundaries**:

- Not a scanning tool - does not execute automated vulnerability scanning
- Not an attack platform - does not provide vulnerability exploitation environment
- Not a project management tool - specialized for target and vulnerability management

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs

- **Time Reduction**: Achieve 2-hour → 10-minute report generation target
- **User Adoption**: Monthly active users growth
- **Report Quality**: User satisfaction with generated reports
- **Knowledge Reuse**: Percentage of vulnerabilities using templates

### Secondary Metrics

- **Project Completion Rate**: Percentage of projects completed on time
- **Collaboration Efficiency**: Team productivity improvements
- **Data Security**: Zero security incidents with stored data
- **Platform Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target

## Competitive Positioning

### Differentiation from Existing Tools

- **vs. DefectDojo/Faraday**: Focus on penetration testing workflow vs. general vulnerability management
- **vs. Traditional Tools**: Modern UX and automation vs. legacy interfaces
- **vs. Generic PM Tools**: Security-specific features and compliance needs
- **vs. Manual Processes**: Dramatic efficiency gains and standardization

### Unique Advantages

1. **Penetration Testing Specialized**: Built specifically for pentest workflows
2. **Modern Technology Stack**: Latest web technologies for superior UX
3. **Security-First Design**: Built with security professionals' needs in mind
4. **Automation Focus**: Minimize manual work while maintaining quality

## Future Vision

### Phase 1 (MVP)

- Core vulnerability recording and basic reporting
- User authentication and basic project management
- Essential knowledge base functionality

### Phase 2 (Growth)

- Advanced reporting features and customization
- Team collaboration and multi-user support
- Integration with common penetration testing tools

### Phase 3 (Scale)

- Enterprise features and advanced security
- API ecosystem and third-party integrations
- Advanced analytics and reporting insights

## Security Considerations

- **Data Sovereignty**: All sensitive data must remain in controlled environment
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every request requires authentication and authorization
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all sensitive operations
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit protection
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and least privilege principle
