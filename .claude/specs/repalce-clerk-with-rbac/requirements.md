# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating from Clerk (third-party authentication service) to a custom RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) authentication system using NextAuth.js v5. The migration will provide complete control over authentication, implement granular permissions, and align with the platform's security-first approach for handling sensitive penetration testing data.

The feature will replace all Clerk dependencies while maintaining user experience continuity and adding enhanced security features required for a professional penetration testing platform.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This authentication migration directly supports the product vision by:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Moving from third-party Clerk to self-hosted authentication ensures all sensitive penetration testing data remains in controlled environments
- **Zero Trust Security**: Implementing custom RBAC enables verification of every request and user action according to security best practices
- **Professional Security Platform**: Provides enterprise-grade authentication suitable for security consulting firms and internal security teams
- **Audit Trail**: Custom implementation allows comprehensive logging of all authentication and authorization events for compliance

The migration aligns with the platform's mission to provide secure, professional tools for penetration testing professionals by ensuring authentication meets the highest security standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want to log in securely using my credentials, so that my sensitive security data and work remains protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a secure login form with email/username and password fields
1.2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate using NextAuth.js v5 and create a secure session
1.3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and prevent access
1.4. WHEN a user exceeds 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL lock the account for 30 minutes and log the security event
1.5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL store session information securely using JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
1.6. WHEN JWT token is tampered with or expired THEN the system SHALL reject the request and require re-authentication
1.7. WHEN database connection fails during authentication THEN the system SHALL fail securely and not allow unauthorized access
1.8. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security manager, I want to assign specific roles to team members, so that each user has appropriate permissions based on their responsibilities and follows least privilege principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2.1. WHEN an administrator creates a user account THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate roles based on user responsibility
2.2. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected resource THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions against their assigned roles efficiently
2.3. IF a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL deny access, display an appropriate error message, and log the unauthorized attempt
2.4. WHEN user roles are modified THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce new permissions without requiring re-login
2.5. WHEN a user is deactivated THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke all access and invalidate all active sessions
2.7. WHEN permission verification fails due to system errors THEN the system SHALL default to denying access and log the failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user accounts and roles through an intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently control team access and maintain security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3.1. WHEN an administrator accesses user management THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive list of all users with their roles and status
3.2. WHEN an administrator creates a new user THEN the system SHALL generate secure credentials and provide them to the administrator
3.3. WHEN an administrator modifies user roles THEN the system SHALL update permissions immediately and log the change with full audit trail
3.4. WHEN an administrator resets a user password THEN the system SHALL generate a secure temporary password and require change on first login
3.5. WHEN an administrator deactivates a user THEN the system SHALL prevent future logins while preserving audit history
3.6. WHEN user management operations fail THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security manager, I want comprehensive audit logs of all authentication events, so that I can monitor system security and investigate any suspicious activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4.1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, IP address, and user agent
4.2. WHEN login attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log failed attempts with relevant security details
4.3. WHEN user permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL log permission denials for security monitoring
4.4. WHEN administrative actions occur THEN the system SHALL log all user management activities with full context
4.5. WHEN audit log entries are created THEN the system SHALL include relevant context information for security monitoring
4.6. WHEN audit log storage fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue operation (fail gracefully, not complex retry)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from Clerk to the new system without losing existing user data or disrupting ongoing work, so that the transition is seamless for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5.1. WHEN migration begins THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing user accounts and profile information (database schema ready)
5.2. WHEN users first access the new system THEN they SHALL be prompted to set new passwords following security complexity requirements
5.3. WHEN migration is complete THEN all Clerk dependencies SHALL be removed and the system SHALL function independently
5.4. WHEN migration validation fails THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and halt the migration process
5.5. WHEN migration is validated THEN all authentication flows SHALL work identically to previous user experience

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Authentication requests SHALL complete within 500ms under normal load
- User permission checks SHALL complete efficiently for small team usage (30 users max)
- The system SHALL support the full team capacity (30 users) with responsive performance
- Session validation SHALL not impact page load times by more than 50ms

### Security

- Passwords SHALL meet complexity requirements: minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters
- Password hashing SHALL use bcryptjs with minimum 12 salt rounds
- JWT tokens SHALL expire within 24 hours and require refresh for continued access
- All authentication events SHALL be logged with complete audit trail
- Failed login attempts SHALL be rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks
- Session management SHALL follow OWASP security guidelines

### Reliability

- Authentication service SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime availability
- System SHALL handle authentication failures gracefully with clear user feedback
- Database connections SHALL include proper retry logic and connection pooling
- Session storage SHALL be resilient to server restarts and maintain user sessions

### Usability

- Login interface SHALL match existing application design and branding
- Error messages SHALL be clear and actionable for users
- Password requirements SHALL be clearly communicated during account setup
- Administrative interface SHALL provide intuitive user and role management
- Migration SHALL be transparent to end users with minimal disruption

### Maintainability

- Authentication code SHALL follow project conventions for TypeScript and React patterns
- API endpoints SHALL use consistent JSend response format
- Database schema SHALL align with existing Prisma patterns and naming conventions
- Code SHALL include comprehensive unit tests with minimum 80% coverage
- Documentation SHALL be updated to reflect new authentication architecture
